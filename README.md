# Rebiber: A tool for normalizing bibtex with official info.

We often cite papers using their arXiv versions without noting that they are already __PUBLISHED__ in some conferences. These unofficial bib entries might violate rules about submissions or camera-ready versions for some conferences. 
We introduce __Rebiber__, a simple tool in Python to fix them automatically. It is based on the official conference information from the [DBLP](https://dblp.org/) or [the ACL anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/) (for NLP conferences)! You can check the list of supported conferences [here](#supported-conferences).
Apart from handling outdated arXiv citations, __Rebiber__ also normalizes citations in a unified way (DBLP-style), supporting abbreviation and value selection.

## Changelog

- **2021.09.06** We fixed a few minor bugs and added features such as sorting and urls to arXiv (if the paper is not in any conferences; thanks to [@nicola-decao](https://github.com/nicola-decao)). We also updated the ACL anthology bib/json to the latest version as well as other conferences.

- **2021.05.30** 
We build a [beta version](https://rebiber.herokuapp.com/) of our **web app for Rebiber**; add new conferences to our dataset; fix a few minor bugs.
- **2021.02.08** 
We now support multiple useful features: 1) turning off some certain values, e.g., "-r url,pages,address" for removing the values from the output, 2) using abbr. to shorten the booktitle values, e.g., `Proceedings of the .* Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics` --> `Proc. of ACL`. More examples are [here.](https://github.com/yuchenlin/rebiber/blob/main/rebiber/abbr.tsv)
- **2021.01.30** 
We build a colab notebook as a simple web demo. [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12oQcLs25CFjI4evsFlWfKD1DfTEiqyCN?usp=sharing)



## Installation

```bash
# pip install rebiber -U # for the stable version
pip install -e git+https://github.com/yuchenlin/rebiber.git#egg=rebiber -U
# rebiber --update  # (optional) update the bib data and the abbr. info  (using wget)
```

OR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuchenlin/rebiber.git
cd rebiber/
pip install -e .
```
If you would like to use the latest github version with more bug fixes, please use the second installation method.

## Usage（v1.1.3）
Normalize your bibtex file with the official conference information:

```bash 
rebiber -i /path/to/input.bib -o /path/to/output.bib
```
You can find a pair of example input and output files in `rebiber/example_input.bib` and `rebiber/example_output.bib`.

| argument | usage|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `-i` | or `--input_bib`.  The path to the input bib file that you want to update |
| `-o` | or `--output_bib`.  The path to the output bib file that you want to save. If you don't specify any `-o` then it will be the same as the `-i`. |
| `-r` | or `--remove`. A comma-separated list of value names that you want to remove, such as "-r pages,editor,volume,month,url,biburl,address,publisher,bibsource,timestamp,doi". Empty by __default__.  |
| `-s` | or `--shorten`. A bool argument that is `"False"` by __default__, used for replacing `booktitle` with abbreviation in `-a`. Used as `-s True`. |
| `-d` | or `--deduplicate`. A bool argument that is `"True"` by __default__, used for removing the duplicate bib entries sharing the same key. Used as `-d True`. |
| `-l` | or `--bib_list`. The path to the list of the bib json files to be loaded. Check [rebiber/bib_list.txt](rebiber/bib_list.txt) for the default file. Usually you don't need to set this argument. |
| `-a` | or `--abbr_tsv`. The list of conference abbreviation data. Check [rebiber/abbr.tsv](rebiber/abbr.tsv) for the default file. Usually you don't need to set this argument. |
| `-u` | or `--update`. Update the local bib-related data with the latest Github version. |
| `-v` | or `--version`. Print the version of current Rebiber. |
| `-st` | or `--sort`. A bool argument that is `"False"` by __default__. used for keeping the original order of the bib entries of the input file. By setting it to be `"True"`, the bib entries are ordered alphabetically in the output file. Used as `-st True`. |

<!-- Or 
```bash
python rebiber/normalize.py \
  -i rebiber/example_input.bib \
  -o rebiber/example_output.bib \
  -l rebiber/bib_list.txt
``` -->


## Example Input and Output
An example input entry with the arXiv information (from Google Scholar or somewhere):
```bib
@article{lin2020birds,
	title={Birds have four legs?! NumerSense: Probing Numerical Commonsense Knowledge of Pre-trained Language Models},
	author={Lin, Bill Yuchen and Lee, Seyeon and Khanna, Rahul and Ren, Xiang},
	journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00683},

```
 

An example normalized output entry with the official information:
```bib
@inproceedings{lin2020birds,
    title = "{B}irds have four legs?! {N}umer{S}ense: {P}robing {N}umerical {C}ommonsense {K}nowledge of {P}re-{T}rained {L}anguage {M}odels",
    author = "Lin, Bill Yuchen  and
      Lee, Seyeon  and
      Khanna, Rahul  and
      Ren, Xiang",
    booktitle = "Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)",
    month = nov,
    year = "2020",
    address = "Online",
    publisher = "Association for Computational Linguistics",
    url = "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.557",
    doi = "10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.557",
    pages = "6862--6868",
}
```


## Supported Conferences 

The `bib_list.txt` contains a list of converted json files of the official bib data. In this repo, we now support the full [ACL anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/), i.e., all papers that are published at *CL conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, etc.) as well as workshops.
Also, we support any conference proceedings that can be downloaded from DBLP, for example, ICLR2020.

Note that to DBLP only allows you to download in batches of 1000 using &h=1000&f=0, where f=0|1000|2000 specifies the starting index. So we have to manually download the bib files of each conference and concatenate them together. `add_conf.sh` takes care of that, too.

The following conferences are supported and their bib/json files are in our `data` folder. You can turn each item on/off in `bib_list.txt`. **Please feel free to create PR for adding new conferences following [this](#adding-a-new-conference)!**

## Adding a new conference

You can manually add any conferences from DBLP by downloading their bib files to our `raw_data` folder, and run a prepared script `add_conf.sh`.

Take ICLR2020 and ICLR2019 as an example:

- Step 1: Go to [DBLP](https://dblp.org/db/conf/iclr/iclr2020.html) 
- Step 2: Download the bib files, and put them here as `raw_data/iclr2020.bib` and `raw_data/iclr2019.bib` (name should be in the format as {conf_name}{year}.bib)
- Step 3: Run script
```bash
bash add_conf.sh iclr 2019 2020
```
